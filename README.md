Code Louisville Project
I've created a beginner portfolio. I've created a responsive portfolio that leads users to other repositories.
The purpose is of the portfolio is to give one page that will lead future employers to projects I've worked on
and my resume. The page changes colors in 2 ways to show an understanding of 2 languages.
