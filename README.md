Code Louisville Project
I've created a beginner portfolio. I've created media queries that alter the photosizes depending on the screen size.
The purpose is of the portfolio is to give one page that will lead future employers to projects I've worked on
and my resume. The page changes colors in 2 ways to show an understanding of 2 languages.
